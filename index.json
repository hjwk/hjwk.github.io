I started investigating the options and I was not let down by the number of possibilities: Höga Kustenleden, Kungsleden, Vålådalen\u0026hellip; In the end, I decided to start with Kungsleden, as it promised to be the most adventurous, being above the polar circle.\nGetting there I was starting from from Göteborg so I took a flight to Stockholm where I got a connection to Luleå. There, I had to quickly get to the train station where I hopped on a train to Kiruna. After spending the night in the STF Hostell I took the Nikkaluotka Express to Nikkualotka, my starting point to the hike.\nAs a sidenote, all of this could have been simpler if I had taken a direct flight to Kiruna on Sunday but I was originally planning to bring a friend along and this was the flight plan we agreed on.\nGetting back My initial plan was to take the train from Abisko to Kiruna and hop into a plane but COVID-19 got in the way and I ended up taking the night train all the way back to Göteborg. It was not cheap and also not very comfortable (no shower, lackluster restaurant, crammed compartment\u0026hellip;) so I can\u0026rsquo;t really recommend it, especially if travelling solo. Door to door, it took me 24 hours to get home.\nItinerary I went for a 6 days hike on the northernmost segment, from Nikkaluokta to Abisko, following advice stating that finishing the journey in Abisko is a rewarding experience. During my hike I also discovered that it meant that the wind was always blowing in my back, which was a welcome surprise.\nDay 1 : Nikkaluotka to Kebnekaise Fjällstation - 19km\nDay 2 : Kebnekaise to Singi Fjällstuga - 14 km\nDay 3 : Singi to Sälka - 14 km\nDay 4 : Sälka to Alesjaure Fjällstuga - 25 km\nDay 5 : Alesjaure to Abiskojaure Fjällstuga - 21 km\nDay 6 : Abiskojaure to Abisko Fjällstation - 12 km\nUpfront cost Item Cost Mountain huts + Hostels 2,850 kr Kebnekaise dinner 400 kr Dry food (6) 600 kr Train to Kiruna from Luleå 439 kr Train from Abisko to Göteborg C 866 kr Flygbussarna 119 kr Flights 1,125 kr NikkaluotkaExpressen bus 200 kr Bus from Göteborg C 30 kr Total 6,629 kr Gear Clothes 3 pairs of Decathlon walking socks 3 merino boxers (Decathlon Forclaz Merino, Icebreaker) 2 long sleeve t-shirts for base layer: Decathlon Forclaz Merino Decathlon Softshell Forclaz Trek 500 jacket.

Most huts have a small shop where they sell snacks, freeze dried food, beer, soda\u0026hellip; I regularly bought chocolate bars and soda cans. The mountain stations of Kebnekaise and Abisko have restaurants but you have to make a reservation. They also propose breakfast.\nWeather I experienced temperatures around 10 °C with moderate northwards wind.

I decided to write this short post because I found Transportsyterelsen\u0026rsquo;s explanations on what you are supposed to do with your car when moving to Sweden to be a bit obtuse.\nAttention You don\u0026rsquo;t need to do anything before you officially move your country of residence to Sweden.\nFirst of all, as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t move your fiscal residency to Sweden you simply continue paying taxes and insurance in your country of origin (if you are a EU resident). It is only when you really move that you legally need to import your car in order to continue to drive it.\nThe steps Get a temporary insurance: i got one at Trygg Hansa, because they were the first ones to agree (not all companies want to issue a temporary insurance).\nRegister for a verification of origin at Transportyrelsen. The first step is to apply for a verification of origin on Transportstyrelsent website. Enter the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s details, pay the fee and send the required documents: registration certificates parts 1 and 2 plus a document proving that you\u0026rsquo;ve been using the car for at least 1 year (I used an old proof of insurance).\nGet an appointment to have your car registered. Once you receive a positive answer you can register at either Bilprovningen or Besikta to get your car registered. This step is most easily accomplished by phone.You get your plate number immediately, the plates themselves will arrive by post a few days later.\nNow that you have your Swedish plate number you can give it to your insurance, which will transfrom your temporary insurance into a regular one.\nOnce registered you need to go back to Besikta (or Bilprovningen, etc.) to pass the technical verification. You can use your plate number to book an appointment.\nOnce you receive your swedish plates, you can send your original plate back to your home country.\nA few days later you will receive an invitation to pay the road tax.\n","permalink":"https://hjwk.github.io/posts/importing-car-sweden/","summary":"A guide to importing your car to Sweden from an EU country","title":"Importing your car to Sweden"},{"content":"Gunnebo slött Gunnebo is the name of a 18th century residence and its gardens.

It is the perfect setting for an afternoon stroll after which some coffee and cinnamon rolls can be degusted at the coffee house situated in the old servants\u0026rsquo; dwelling.\nMarstrand Marstrand is a popular sailing resort situated on an island north of Göteborg but what I like the most are the several paths you can take a stroll on. There are also a few Cold War vestiges here and there. The town itself is nice enough but nothing out of the ordinary in Sweden.\nDyrön Another island, a dozen kilometers North of Marstrand.

There are many entry points and my favorites are the ones in Hagryd Dala and Långås.\nKullavik Kullavik is a small village south of Göteborg.

A letter containing the personnumer should arrive shortly. Once received you can book an appointment for the kortID through Skatteverket\u0026rsquo;s website. Do not forget to bring your passport with you as national ID cards are not recognized as valid ID documents for administrative purposes in Sweden.\nYou need a swedish identity card to open a bank account, even if you are an EU citizen Surprisingly, swedish banks do not really comply with the european directive stating that any EU citizen should be able to open a bank account in any EU country. It is technically possible but you only get a limited account and it will take longer than getting the ID card anyway. Be advised that most banks charge you for their services. I chose Handelsbanken because their web application seemed good enough for my needs and they charge slightly less than the competition. They also happen to have a branch just outside my workplace.\nTips The rental market is overburdened Airbnb has a number of interesting options for short/medium term accomodations but it will quickly run dry, especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t want roommates. For medium-term accomodations Qasa is probably the best(or only) option but the competition is fierce so it can take you a couple of weeks to find a place, depending on how picky/tight on your budget you are.\nOnce you have a personnumer it is time to register on HomeQ. This website is a private alternative to the municipal housing queues and has a reputation for being slightly faster but it will still take around 1 year to get a first hand contract.\nGet yourself a Wise (previously TransferWise) debit card before you move As mentioned earlier some time will pass before you get a swedish acount and a card. A solution to that problem is using a Wise debit card. Wise is originally a company that allowed you to make international transfers at attractive conversion rates but they recently introduced debit cards: you can create an account in the currency of interest, transfer some money (you will have to pay a small fee but the conversion rate is worth it) and voilà !

I bought the following to replace them:\n12V Noctua NF-A4x10 (40x40x10mm) Noctua NF-A4x20 FLX Ventilateur PC to replace the control box exhaustion fan. 12V GELID 50x50x15 mm to to replace the control box fan. Dampeners Another contributor to the noise were the vibrations produced by the stepper motors. A quick and easy upgrade consisted in mounting dampeners between the chassis and the motors. It really helped reduce the noise levels. I used cheap dampers for Nema17 stepper motors I found on Banggood.\nMirror surface The mirror surface is an advantageous alternative to the plastic plate that came with the printer. You get a clean, smooth surface for the bottom of your prints and you no longer need to play with glue, provided you have a good level and clean the mirror with an alcoholic solution every 1 or 2 prints. I simply used an IKEA mirror I cut to size with a glass knife.\nConvenience upgrades Octopi I quickly grew tired of copying .gcode files to the SD card and switched to Octopi. Octopi is a Rapsberry Pi distribution of Octoprint, a webserver from which you can control your 3D printer. All you need is a Raspberry Pi, a SD card and an usb cable to connect the raspberry to 3d printer. You also have the option of mounting a camera but it is not really useful, unless you really want to create timelapses.\nControlled relay A powerful feature of Octopi is its support of various plugins. One of them is PSU Control which main purpose is, as its name indicates, to control the power supply of the printer.
